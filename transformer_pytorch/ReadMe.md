Bacis layers and blocks can be found from _Layers.py_ .<br>
<br>
The construction of the Transformer model can be found in _build\_model.py_ .<br>
<br>
Some information and functions about how to run the model can be found in _run\_model.py_ .<br>
<br>
There is a simple test for our model. Try to use _Simple\_example.py_.

\-\-Update\-\-<br>
There are some problems about the type of tensors which makes the codes raise Error. I'll fix them as soon as possible. My apology for these mistakes. 
<br><br>
If you want just know how to build the Transformer, I think these codes are still useful.
